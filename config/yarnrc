# IMPORTANT NOTES
# - Having the mutex option and the cache-folder option together in this file
#   ensures that an invocation of yarn will either get BOTH options together
#   or neither.
# - The cache-folder MUST be a location other than the default so that a
#   yarn invocation that does not read this file will not use the shared and
#   protected cache.
--cache-folder /var/cache/adapt/yarn

# Default is to acquire the cache mutex for all yarn operations
--mutex "file:/var/cache/adapt/yarn/.yarn-mutex"

# But for yarn commands that do NOT read or write to the cache, using
# mutex "file" will protect against two of this type of yarn operation
# happening in the same directory at the same time. That's actually not
# quite correct, but the correct fix can only be made within yarn. And holding
# the cache mutex for all yarn run operations serializes our testing way too
# much.
--run.mutex file
