# Cache folder is relative to where this yarnrc file is found.
# This is used for segregating a set of yarn invocations to use a common
# cache. This is used in some testing, particularly for CI so that parallel
# test "threads" do not share a common cache.
--cache-folder ./.cache/yarn

# Default is to acquire the cache mutex for all yarn operations
--mutex "file:./.yarn-mutex"

# But for yarn commands that do NOT read or write to the cache, using
# mutex "file" will protect against two of this type of yarn operation
# happening in the same directory at the same time. That's actually not
# quite correct, but the correct fix can only be made within yarn. And holding
# the cache mutex for all yarn run operations serializes our testing way too
# much.
